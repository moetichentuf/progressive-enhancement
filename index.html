    Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to
    commiserate. They said, <span class="quotations">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</span>
    The farmer said, <span class="quotations">“<em>Maybe</em>.”</span> The next day the horse came back
    bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <span class="quotations">“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</span>
    The farmer again said, <span class="quotations">“<em>Maybe</em>.”</span>

    The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
    The neighbors then said, <span class="quotations">“Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,”</span>
    and the farmer responded, <span class="quotations">“<em>Maybe</em>.”</span> The next day the
    conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a
    broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <span class="quotations">“Isn’t that great!”</span>
    Again, he said, <span class="quotations">“<em>Maybe</em>.”</span>

    The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell
    whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you
    never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span
        class="good">good</span> fortune.

    Conclusion
    <span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span
            class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's
    not make a big deal out of it...</p>
